{"name":"Midi scripter","tagline":"Program to generate a MIDI file from simple commands in text files.","body":"__Project status:__ no longer under development, but still useful.  I may expand it if anyone expresses interest.  \r\n__Developed:__ 2005\r\n\r\nThis program generates a MIDI file from simple commands in text files. It was specifically created for someone who is visually impaired, so it is intended to be accessible to anyone any easy to use.\r\n\r\nI mainly wrote it for two reasons: as a special request from <a href=\"http://pb-games.com/\">Philip Bennefall</a>, and as a little project to learn the <a href=\"http://www.ruby-lang.org/\">Ruby</a> programming language.  As such, I don't guarantee that it is generally useful or complete.  However, it does work for Philip's particular purposes, and I think it will be useful to others.  If there is enough interest I will certainly expand it.  This is still very much in the beta stage, so YMMV.\r\n\r\n![MIDI Scripter Screenshot](http://assets.borsboom.io/midi-scripter/screen_shot.gif)\r\n\r\nThis program is free software and you may do just about anything you like with it (see <a href=\"http://downloads.borsboom.io/midi-scripter/README.html#license\">the license</a> for more details).\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nSee the <a href=\"http://downloads.borsboom.io/midi-scripter/README.html\">README</a> file for more information.\r\n\r\n### Downloads\r\n\r\n* <a href=\"http://downloads.borsboom.io/midi-scripter/MidiScripter-0.5.0-win32.zip\">MidiScripter-0.5.0-win32.zip</a>: Windows executable - just unzip it and run.\r\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/borsboom/midi-scripter): Source code - will run on any platform with a Ruby interpreter (e.g. Linux, Mac OS X, Un*x, etc).\r\n\r\n### Demo Songs\r\n\r\nThanks to <a href=\"http://pb-games.com/\">Philip Bennefall</a> for providing these demo songs:\r\n\r\n| Song | Link |\r\n| ---- | ---- |\r\n| World Song: | <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/borsboom-downloads/midi-scripter/demo_songs/countrysong.mp3\">MP3</a> / <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/borsboom-downloads/midi-scripter/demo_songs/countrysong.mid\">MIDI</a> / <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/borsboom-downloads/midi-scripter/demo_songs/countrysong.zip\">Source</a> |\r\n| Orchestral Theme: | <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/borsboom-downloads/midi-scripter/demo_songs/orchestral_theme.mp3\">MP3</a> / <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/borsboom-downloads/midi-scripter/demo_songs/orchestral_theme.mid\">MIDI</a> / <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/borsboom-downloads/midi-scripter/demo_songs/orchestral_theme.zip\">Source</a> |\r\n| Rock Song: | <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/borsboom-downloads/midi-scripter/demo_songs/rock_song.mp3\">MP3</a> / <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/borsboom-downloads/midi-scripter/demo_songs/rock_song.mid\">MIDI</a> / <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/borsboom-downloads/midi-scripter/demo_songs/rock_song.zip\">Source</a> |\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
